# Authorship-Attribution

Analyzed and evaluated the performance of various machine learning models (KNN, Neural Networks and Ensemble Methods) in Python for authorship attribution tasks. The dataset consisted of 1000 (total 5000) scrapped tweets from each Twitter handle: @espn, @Google, @Starbucks, @ndtv, @urstrulyMahesh, and @VP. Built a collective vocabulary and evaluated the machine learning models for the corresponding bag of words and word embeddings to get the features. Collaborated with a group of six individuals for the machine learningÂ course.
